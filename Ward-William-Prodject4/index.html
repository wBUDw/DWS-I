				<p>American football's roots begin with soccer and rugby. The game was played with either a bigger emphasis with soccer or rugby but both played parts in the origin of American football. The first American football game was played on November 6, 1869 between Rutgers and Princeton. The game had 25 players on each team, using a round ball, and used rugby and soccer rules. The ball could not be picked up or carried, but it could be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the ultimate goal of advancing it into the opponent's goal. For many years the hosting school defined the rules for the game. </p>
				<p>Yale, Columbia, Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19, 1873 to create a standard set of rules for all schools to adhere to. Teams were set at 20 players each, and fields of 400 by 250 feet were specified. Harvard chose not to join the conference, because they preferred the rugby-style game that allowed running with the ball.</p>
				<p>After two Princeton players witnesses a rugby styled game between Harvard and Yale, they went back home a convinced their school that this was the style of play they wanted. Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Columbia then agreed to intercollegiate play using a form of rugby union rules with a modified scoring system. These schools formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, although Yale did not join until 1879. Yale player Walter Camp passed rule changes in 1880 that reduced the team size from 15 to 11 players and instituted the snap (one player gives possession of the ball to another to initiate the play) to replace the chaotic and inconsistent scrum. Due to teams in 1881 taking advantage of a running clock and no necessity to move the ball after the snap, the snap was regressed back to a scum until 1882. Walter Camp again passed rules in 1882 that required a team to gain five yards in three snaps or turn the ball over.</p>
				<p>With the new five yards in three snaps rules in place, the field would be marked with five-yard increments giving the modern version of the game one of its first nicknames <strong>Gridiron</strong>. Gridiron is used in place of the name American football in some instances in international play.</p>
